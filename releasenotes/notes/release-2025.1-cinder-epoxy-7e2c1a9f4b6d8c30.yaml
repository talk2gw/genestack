  Genestack Cinder has been updated for Epoxy (`2025.1`) with a focus on safer
  day-2 operations, cleaner defaults, and repeatable installs.

features:
  - |
    Cinder chart and image baselines were updated for the `2025.1` release
    track.
  - |
    Cinder helper jobs now use the `openstack-client` image family instead of
    the legacy helper pattern, aligning Cinder with current Genestack tooling.
  - |
    Community defaults keep Cinder disabled by default (`openstack-components`)
    so users can opt in intentionally.
  - |
    Upstream Cinder `26.0.0` adds the `cinder.wsgi` module for cleaner
    WSGI app loading (for example `cinder.wsgi.api:application`), which
    simplifies deployment patterns.
  - |
    Upstream Cinder/Ceph adds a backup retention option to keep only the last
    `n` snapshots per volume backup, reducing source-side Ceph snapshot growth.
  - |
    Epoxy highlights call out Cinder Brick multipath setup/management
    improvements and broad driver updates across common backends.

upgrade:
  - |
    If you use Fujitsu backends with password authentication, set
    `fujitsu_passwordless = False`. In 2025.1 the default is `True`.
  - |
    Existing environments that use `keystone_authtoken.auth_uri` should plan
    to migrate to `www_authenticate_uri`.

deprecations:
  - |
    Remove deprecated iSER options from local overrides if still present:
    `num_iser_scan_tries`, `iser_target_prefix`, `iser_ip_address`,
    `iser_port`, `iser_helper`.
  - |
    Pure Storage `queue_depth` is deprecated and is expected to be removed in
    `2026.1`.

fixes:
  - |
    Cinder install/reinstall flows were validated in hyperconverged lab runs,
    including a successful immediate rerun (`install-cinder.sh`) for
    idempotency.
  - |
    Cinder API and scheduler runtime validation showed healthy replicas and no
    fatal runtime errors in sampled logs.
  - |
    Upstream Cinder bug fixes directly relevant to operators include:
    - `Bug #2105961`: NVMe-oF connector validation now checks `nqn` correctly.
    - `Bug #2111461`: `cinder-manage` purge path fixed for FK constraint cases.
    - `Bug #1907295`: attachment update failures now return `409` instead of
      generic `500` in invalid state paths.
    - `Bug #2082587`: backup restore TypeError fix.
  - |
    Upstream Ceph/RBD-related Cinder fixes include:
    - RBD `Bug #2115985`: manage-volume fix for `multiattach` and
      `replication_enabled` type properties.
    - NFS snapshot regression fix (`Bug #2074377`) and attached-volume snapshot
      metadata fix (`Bug #1989514`) included in the Epoxy cycle.

other:
  - |
    Known warnings seen during validation were limited to expected deprecation
    signals (for example `auth_uri`) and did not block deployment.
